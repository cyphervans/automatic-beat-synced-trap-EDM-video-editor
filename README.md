â”œâ”€â”€ clips/ # put video clips here
â”œâ”€â”€ music/ # put your audio file here

##  Setup
1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/trap_video_editor.git
   cd trap_video_editor

Create a virtual environment (recommended):

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows


Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


Add your video clips to the clips/ folder
Add your music file to the music/ folder (default: track.wav).

Run the script:

python trap_edit.py

Example Output

The script generates a beat-synced edit and saves it to:

exports/final_edit.mp4

 Notes

Make sure you have FFmpeg installed, since moviepy depends on it.

TextClip may require ImageMagick if you want advanced text rendering.

Works best with short clips and trap/EDM tracks with clear beats.
